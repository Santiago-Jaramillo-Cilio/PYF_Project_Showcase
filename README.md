# **FoodHub Order Analysis**

## **Context**
As the number of restaurants in New York increases, the demand for online food delivery services grows rapidly. Students and busy professionals often rely on these services due to their hectic schedules. FoodHub, a food aggregator, provides access to a wide variety of restaurants through a single smartphone app, streamlining the process of ordering and delivering food.

The app allows restaurants to receive direct online orders from customers, and FoodHub assigns delivery personnel to pick up and deliver these orders. The delivery person uses the app to track the order, confirm pick-up and delivery, and the customer can rate their experience. FoodHub earns revenue by collecting a fixed margin from restaurants for each order.
